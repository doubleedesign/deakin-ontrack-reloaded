## OnTrack Reloaded: Front-end 

Yeah, it's Yet Another React app. I would have liked to take Vue out for another spin but found it was a bit tricky to get Apollo Client working with it and get up to speed on how to do what I wanted quickly enough - I started building this in Week 0 of a trimester. I use React at work, so I'm a lot more familiar with it and some of the learnings from this project are more immediately applicable this way.

If you want to build your own front-end with another library or framework, you totally could. The `server` part of this repo runs standalone, so you could replace my `frontend` folder with your own app. I'd like to say it's on the roadmap to build multiple front-end apps using different libraries/frameworks and study the pros and cons, but I think we all know I won't have time for that any time soon, so I'd love to see what you come up with if you build your own!
